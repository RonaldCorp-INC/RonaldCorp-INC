Hello. 

I go by Ronald. Yes, with the period at the end. Every time. 

A while ago I got really frustrated that I couldn't find a legitimate enough autoclicker, or, rather, one that I could responsibly trust. So, I said; "fine, I'll do it myself". 
And now I am learning to make secure, simple tools, for guys who don't WANT to go on a spree of back corner tool searching.
